# Unix-commands-simulation-system-programming

C programming to simulate a bash shell functionality of the following unix commands:
* ls
* ps
* cp
* mv
* grep

These commands are to be implemented explicitly using C and executed via myshell <br/>
process. Already existing implementation of these commands in bash such as by using <br/> 
system() is not used.  Implemented code has 4 to 5 options implementation per command.
